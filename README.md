### Created as part of the curriculum for full stack web development at [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/carrmichele) 

Technologies used: Node, Express, Javascript, Angular, HTML5, CSS3

## User stories:
1) User can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2) If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

3) If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
